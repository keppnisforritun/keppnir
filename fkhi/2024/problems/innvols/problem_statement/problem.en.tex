Ingfríður has grown curious about her internal content
description. She heard that various properties of an 
individual can be deduced from these data, so she has
to try it. After getting the data sent over from the company Encode
she has everything she needs. To analyse the data she
needs to find sections that match known patterns, but
if analysing some sections is good, analysing all sections
must be better. Thus Ingfríður wants to analyse all sections.
We define a section to be all characters in the data
from some specific starting character to some ending
character.

\section*{Input}
The input contains a single line giving the
internal content description of Ingfríður. The description
consists of the letters \texttt{A}, \texttt{C}, \texttt{G}
and \texttt{T} and has no spaces.
The description is at most $100$ letters in length.

\section*{Output}
For each section in the description print one line,
the number of occurrences it has in the description and
then the section itself, separated by spaces. A section
should not be printed multiple times in the output even if
it occurs multiple times. The lines should be printed in
descending order by the number of occurrences. If two
sections are tied for number of occurrences, resolve the
tie by putting the section that comes first alphabetically
before the other.
