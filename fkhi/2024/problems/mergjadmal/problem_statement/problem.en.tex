After turning in the draft of the problems for
Forritunarkeppni Háskólanna á Íslandi the results were that
the prose was too terse and dated. It had to appeal to a 
younger audience better, to use their language. This problem
exists as a response to this criticism. This sentence is
your last chance to turn back and spare your eyes from this
horror.

Isn't it way lame to have to chew through all these
problems? Totally wack, not a good vibe.
Way too many still feeling the wild weekend, a totally
untubular feeling.
But don't trip, this problem will be a totally rad break
from the mansplaining of the other problems.
After finishing this problem you'll be totally Knuthpilled
and ACmaxxed, a sigma programmer, you'll wreck the rest
right away, no cap.
Skibidi ohio gyatt rizz everyone at the next fortnite
tournament with those mad skillz, you'll be the goat of the
party for sure.

\section*{Input}

The input dumps a whole bunch of printable ASCII letters on
you. Not more than $1000$ of them though, so you can chill.
And no whitespace, that would just be real un-rad of us.
Watch out dude, it might be empty.

\section*{Output}

Print \texttt{Mergjad!} if $69$ or $420$ appear in the input,
otherwise, \texttt{Leim!}.
