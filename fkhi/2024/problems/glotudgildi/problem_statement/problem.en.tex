The universities of Iceland have decided to host a large
Nim tournament.
Exactly $n$ teams have registered, and each team will compete
exactly once against every other team.
As is well known there are no ties in Nim,
so in each game there is exactly one winning team which
receives $1$ point.
At the end the scores of every team have been collected,
but in all the excitement the actual results of individual
games got lost!
This is not good, so Jörmunrekur is going to try to guess
what the results looked like.
The odds that he guesses right are then dependant on the
number of ways the tournament could have gone.
Thus this needs to be calculated as soon as possible!

Consider for example a tournament with teams $A, B, C$
and final scores $1, 1, 1$.
Possibly $A$ beat $B$, $B$ beat $C$ and $C$ beat $A$.
But it could also be that $A$ beat $C$, $C$ beat $B$ and
$B$ beat $A$.
We can see that these are the only options, so in this case
the answer would be $2$.

\section*{Input}

The input begins with a single integer $0 \leq n \leq 16$.
On the next line there are $n$ integers, each also at least
$0$ and at most $16$.
The $i$-th integer denotes the score of the $i$-th team.

\section*{Output}

Print the number of ways the tournament could have gone.
Two ways are considered different if some team beat another
in one way, but not in the other.
