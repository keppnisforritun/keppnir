\problemname{Hot Dog Deals}

At the university shop the price for a single hot dog is $299$~ISK (Icelandic
kr√≥nas), and the price for a soda is $249$~ISK. They also have two great deals:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A hot dog and a soda for $499$~ISK.
    \item Two hot dogs and a soda for $549$~ISK.
\end{itemize}

A group of hungry university students have gathered outside the shop. Each of
them wants to buy a certain number of hot dogs and a certain number of sodas.
Being poor university students, they really have to be careful about how they
spend their money. They realize that if they buy all their hot dogs and sodas
together, and make good use of the two deals that the shop offers, they may be
able to save a lot of money.

number of hot dogs and the total number of sodas that the students want.

\section*{Output}

their number of hot dogs and sodas.
